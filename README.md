# Udacity Landing Page Project

This a landing page built from scratch rather than using the template provided by Udacity. The images used are from pexel, a website that offers free stock photos. I tried to make everything fit a similar theme from the font used to the colors and the styles of pictures.

I made it responsive and added a hamburger menu when used on smaller devices.
